          <h3>AI is ruining society</h3>
          <p>Not only is AI outright theft of intellectual property utilized for the purpose of completely replacing artists in the workforce, but it is also contributing to the downfall of critical thinking and the devaluation of arts and culture, and the outright destruction of the environment.</p> 
          <p>It's an insidious thing. People are forgetting how to research and think on their own. The lack of willingness to research is directly correlated with the lack of due dilligence ahead of the 2024 Presidential election, which subsequently lead to a rise in post-emptive Google searches for queries such as "What is a tariff?" and "Can I change my vote?"</p>
          <p>We need to reclaim our dedication to mastery through effort, if only because it serves to make each individual more critical and appreciative of the world around them. In this essay I will...</p>

          <h3>Book Review: A Woman of No Importance</h3>
          <p>A harrowing tale of WWII heroics, pulled off by a woman nobody believed in. Virginia Hall was not only a woman, but a disabled woman. She was an amputee who risked her life by acting as a spy in annexed France at the height of Nazi occupation.</p>

We are all governed by taste, and with something as subjective as shipping, what one fan may consider an ideal relationship, may come off as horrible to another.</p>
